# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Lab Projects

This repository contains a collection of hands-on **cybersecurity labs** designed to simulate real-world scenarios in a controlled environment. The goal is to demonstrate core competencies in **threat detection, system hardening, monitoring, log analysis, and incident response** using modern tools and techniques.

These labs were built using a combination of **virtual machines**, **Kali Linux**, **Windows 10**, **Security Onion**, and other open-source tools to emulate attacks and defensive strategies.

## üìö Lab Topics & Skills Demonstrated

### ‚úÖ 1. Packet Analysis with Wireshark
- Captured and analyzed traffic for suspicious packets
- Identified common attack patterns (e.g., ARP spoofing, DNS poisoning)

### ‚úÖ 2. Threat Hunting with Security Onion
- Monitored logs using Kibana and Elasticsearch
- Detected brute force attempts and port scans
- Applied filters and queries for deep log inspection

### ‚úÖ 3. Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap & Nessus
- Performed internal scans to identify misconfigurations and outdated services
- Reported critical CVEs and tested patch effectiveness

### ‚úÖ 4. SIEM Alerting and Log Correlation
- Used Wazuh and Security Onion to generate real-time alerts
- Correlated multiple log sources for suspicious user behavior

### ‚úÖ 5. Active Directory Attack Simulation
- Simulated credential harvesting and privilege escalation
- Identified attack signatures using log monitoring

### ‚úÖ 6. Host-Based Intrusion Detection
- Deployed Wazuh agent on endpoints
- Monitored file changes, registry keys, and unauthorized access attempts
